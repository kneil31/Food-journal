# Food Prep Tracker ðŸ¥—

This repo helps me track my weekly food prep, organize recipes, and manage shopping lists.

## Structure
- `weekly-plans/`: My food prep plans by week
- `recipes/`: Categorized recipes I use or want to try
- `shopping-lists/`: Weekly grocery lists + pantry essentials
- `templates/`: Markdown templates for reuse

## Goal
To save time, eat healthier, and reduce food waste.
